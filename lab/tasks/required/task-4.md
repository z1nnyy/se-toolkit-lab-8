# Task 4 — Diagnose a Failure and Make the Agent Proactive

## Background

Everything you built in Tasks 1–3 is now the tool you use to solve a real problem. This task proves that an AI agent is not just a novelty chat UI. It can investigate failures for you, and it can keep watching the system after you stop asking questions.

The backend version in this lab contains a planted bug in a failure path. To surface it reliably, you will temporarily stop PostgreSQL and trigger a request. First teach the agent to investigate that failure in one pass. Then make it proactive with a scheduled health check in the chat. Finally, fix the bug and verify that the system becomes healthy again.

## Part A — Teach the agent a one-shot investigation

### What to do in Part A

1. Enhance the observability skill from Task 3.

   When the user asks **"What went wrong?"** or **"Check system health"**, the skill should guide the agent to:
   - Search recent error logs first
   - Extract a trace ID if one is available
   - Fetch the matching trace
   - Summarize the findings concisely instead of dumping raw JSON

   A good investigation flow is:

   - `logs_error_count` on a fresh recent window
   - `logs_search` scoped to the most likely failing service
   - `traces_get` for the most relevant recent `trace_id`
   - one short explanation that explicitly mentions both log evidence and trace evidence

2. Stop PostgreSQL:

   ```terminal
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret stop postgres
   ```

3. Open the Flutter app, trigger a request that makes nanobot list labs/items, and keep that chat open. You will reuse the same chat in Part B.

   Good prompts for this planted bug are:

   - **"What labs are available?"**
   - **"List the labs"**
   - **"Which lab should I explore?"**

   These prompts typically make nanobot call the LMS tool that lists labs,
   which reaches the backend `GET /items/` route. That route contains the
   planted bug for this task.

   Good nanobot logs to expect in this part include tool calls such as:

   - `mcp_obs_logs_error_count`
   - `mcp_obs_logs_search`
   - `mcp_obs_traces_get`

4. Ask the agent:

   **"What went wrong?"**

   The response should be a single coherent investigation that cites at least one recent error log and one matching trace, and names the affected service plus the root failing operation.

   Trigger the failure immediately before asking so the agent works with fresh
   observability data instead of stale older errors.

   For this planted bug, the key discrepancy to notice is:

   - logs and traces show a real PostgreSQL / SQLAlchemy failure
   - the backend response path misreports it as `404 Items not found`

### Checkpoint for Part A

1. With PostgreSQL stopped, ask the agent **"What went wrong?"**
2. The response should mention both log evidence and trace evidence.
3. Paste the response into `REPORT.md` under `## Task 4A — Multi-step investigation`.

## Part B — Schedule a proactive health check in the same chat

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not refresh the Flutter page during this part. Cron jobs created from the web chat are tied to the current chat session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this task, use the built-in `cron` tool for the recurring chat-bound health check. Do not substitute `HEARTBEAT.md` here.

### What to do in Part B

1. In that same open Flutter chat, ask the agent:

   > Create a health check for this chat that runs every 2 minutes using your cron tool. Each run should check for LMS/backend errors in the last 2 minutes, inspect a trace if needed, and post a short summary here. If there are no recent errors, say the system looks healthy.

2. Ask the agent:

   **"List scheduled jobs."**

   You should see the new health-check job.

   Good nanobot logs to expect here include tool calls such as:

   - `cron({"action":"add", ...})`
   - `cron({"action":"list"})`

3. While PostgreSQL is still stopped, trigger one more request so there is a fresh failure inside the 2-minute window.

4. Wait for the next cron cycle. The agent should proactively post a health report into the same chat.

   If your first scheduled report still says the system looks healthy, that usually means the failure was not triggered inside the most recent 2-minute window yet. Trigger one more LMS-backed request and wait for the next cycle.

5. Add a screenshot or transcript of that proactive report to `REPORT.md` under `## Task 4B — Proactive health check`.

6. Ask the agent to remove the short-interval test job.

7. Restart PostgreSQL before moving on:

   ```terminal
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret start postgres
   ```


### Checkpoint for Part B

1. The agent can list the scheduled job after you create it.
2. A proactive health report appears in the same Flutter chat while the failure is still present.
3. Add that proactive report to `REPORT.md` under `## Task 4B — Proactive health check`.

## Part C — Fix the planted bug and verify recovery

### What to do in Part C

1. Use the findings from Parts A and B to identify the planted bug in the backend failure-handling path and fix it.

   Concretely: inspect the backend code that translates internal exceptions into HTTP responses. Find where the real database/backend failure is being hidden or misreported, and change that code so the true failure becomes visible.

   The planted bug is in a failure path, so focus on code that translates backend exceptions into HTTP responses. Be suspicious of broad `except Exception` blocks that may hide the real cause.

2. Rebuild and redeploy:

   ```terminal
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret build backend
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret up -d
   ```

3. Trigger the failure path again after the redeploy:
   - Stop PostgreSQL
   - Make a request through the Flutter app that asks nanobot to list or choose labs
   - Ask the agent: **"What went wrong?"**

   Before the fix, this request path tends to return a misleading `404 Items not
   found` even though PostgreSQL is down. After your fix, the agent should now
   surface the real underlying backend or database failure instead of that
   broken exception-handling path. When judging the result, focus on the newest
   post-redeploy request rather than older stale logs or traces from before the
   fix.

   When verifying the fix, focus on the newest logs and traces after the redeploy. Older pre-fix `404` records may still be visible in broader time windows.

4. Restart PostgreSQL.

5. If the web chat disconnected during the redeploy, reopen `http://<your-vm-ip-address>:42002/flutter` and log in again.

6. Create a fresh short health check in the current chat:

   > Create a health check for this chat that runs every 2 minutes. Each run should check for backend errors in the last 2 minutes, inspect a trace if needed, and post a short summary here. If there are no recent errors, say the system looks healthy. Use your cron tool.

7. Wait for the next cron cycle. It should now report that the system looks healthy.

   Good nanobot logs to expect after recovery include:

   - `cron({"action":"add", ...})`
   - `mcp_obs_logs_error_count({"minutes": 2})`
   - a health report that says no recent backend errors were found

   Older pre-fix logs and traces may still be visible in VictoriaLogs and VictoriaTraces for a while. For recovery verification, trust the newest post-redeploy request and the newest scheduled health report.

8. Ask the agent to either change the health check to every 15 minutes or remove the test job.


### Checkpoint for Part C

Document the recovery in `REPORT.md` under `## Task 4C — Bug fix and recovery`:

1. **Root cause** — what was the planted bug and where was it?
2. **Fix** — what did you change? (paste the diff or describe it)
3. **Post-fix failure check** — paste the agent's response to **"What went wrong?"** after redeploy, showing the real underlying failure instead of the buggy handler path
4. **Healthy follow-up** — paste or screenshot the later healthy report after PostgreSQL is back
