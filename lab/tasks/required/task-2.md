# Task 2 — Deploy the Agent and Add a Web Client

## Background

In Task 1 you installed nanobot, connected it to the Qwen API and the LMS backend, and chatted with it in the terminal on your VM via `nanobot agent`. That's great for development, but users need a web interface.

There's a problem: **Telegram is blocked from Russian servers.** Your university VM can't reach `api.telegram.org`. So instead of a Telegram bot, we use a **WebSocket bridge** — a custom nanobot channel plugin that accepts connections over WebSocket. Any web app can connect to it. This is a real-world pattern: when a platform is blocked, you build an alternative transport.

In this task you:

1. Deploy nanobot as a Docker service (running `nanobot gateway` instead of `nanobot agent`)
2. Add a custom WebSocket channel so web clients can connect
3. Add a Flutter web chat client that talks to the agent through the WebSocket

### Architecture you are building

Keep this request flow in mind while working:

```text
browser -> caddy -> nanobot webchat channel -> nanobot gateway -> mcp_lms -> backend
nanobot gateway -> qwen-code-api -> Qwen
nanobot gateway -> mcp_webchat -> nanobot webchat UI relay -> browser
```

If something fails, identify which hop is broken instead of debugging the
whole stack at once.

### Security note

Your repo-local `nanobot/config.json` and your Docker env file may contain real
secrets such as API keys and access keys. Keep them local. Do not commit them
to Git.

## Part A — Deploy nanobot as a Docker service

In Task 1 you ran `nanobot agent` from the VM terminal. For production, nanobot runs as `nanobot gateway` — a persistent service that listens for connections from channels (WebSocket, Telegram, etc.).

### What to do in Part A

1. Reuse the repo-local `nanobot/` project you created in Task 1.

   It already contains your `config.json`, `workspace/`, and the dependencies you added there.
   From this point on, treat `nanobot/` inside the repository as the deployable copy of your agent project.
   When you change agent config or skills for the Docker deployment, edit the files in `nanobot/`.

2. Your repo-local `nanobot/` directory already contains two files for Docker deployment. Read them before proceeding:

   - **`entrypoint.py`** — resolves Docker environment variables into `config.json` at runtime, writes `config.resolved.json`, then launches `nanobot gateway`. It uses `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings` to read env vars and `nanobot.config.load_config()` to manipulate the typed config. It also wraps the gateway and every MCP server with `opentelemetry-instrument` for distributed tracing.

     The entrypoint configures MCP servers for `lms` (Task 1) and `webchat` (Part B of this task). A third MCP server (`obs`) is commented out — you will enable it in Task 3.

     A good mental model for `entrypoint.py` is:

     1. Read `config.json`
     2. Override only the fields that must come from Docker env vars
     3. Write `config.resolved.json`
     4. `execvp(...)` into `opentelemetry-instrument nanobot gateway`

   - **`Dockerfile`** — multi-stage build with `uv` (same pattern as `backend/Dockerfile`). Accepts `APP_UID`/`APP_GID` build args so the container user matches your host UID/GID. Final CMD: `python /app/nanobot/entrypoint.py`.

   You do not need to edit either file. Your job is to make sure the rest of the stack (config, deps, compose, Caddy) lines up with what these files expect.

   By the end of Part A, you should have modified at least:

   - `nanobot/pyproject.toml` (uncommented dependencies)
   - `docker-compose.yml` (uncommented nanobot service)

3. Uncomment the scaffolded `nanobot` service block in `docker-compose.yml` and adapt it to your implementation:

   - Keep the build context at `./nanobot` with `additional_contexts: workspace: .` so the image can access `mcp/` and the root project.
   - If you bind-mount local source directories for live editing, run the container as the host user (for example with `user: "${HOST_UID}:${HOST_GID}"`) so both the host and the container can edit the same files without ownership conflicts. On the VM, get these values with `id -u` and `id -g`, then put them into your Docker env file as `HOST_UID=...` and `HOST_GID=...`.
   - Make your `nanobot/Dockerfile` consistent with that runtime choice. A good pattern is to accept `APP_UID` and `APP_GID` as build args, create the container user with those IDs, and use the same IDs when copying writable app files into the image. Otherwise the image may still contain directories owned by a different baked-in UID/GID even though Compose runs the process as your host user.
   - You do not have to mount the whole repo into `/app`. A cleaner setup is to mount only the directories nanobot needs to edit or read, for example `./nanobot:/app/nanobot`, `./mcp:/app/mcp`, `./nanobot-websocket-channel:/app/nanobot-websocket-channel`, and read-only docs like `./wiki:/app/wiki:ro`.
   - Check that the environment variables match what your `entrypoint.py` reads.
   - Notice that the scaffold uses container-local URLs such as `http://backend:...` and `http://qwen-code-api:...` rather than the VM-shell `localhost` values from Task 1.
   - Keep it on `lms-network`.

   Why not `localhost` inside Docker?

   - In Task 1, `localhost` meant "this VM"
   - In Docker, `localhost` inside the `nanobot` container means "the nanobot container itself"
   - To reach other services, use their Compose service names such as `backend` and `qwen-code-api`

   A useful mapping table:

   - `LLM_API_KEY` -> `providers.custom.apiKey`
   - `LLM_API_BASE_URL` -> `providers.custom.apiBase`
   - `LLM_API_MODEL` -> `agents.defaults.model`
   - `NANOBOT_GATEWAY_CONTAINER_ADDRESS` -> `gateway.host`
   - `NANOBOT_GATEWAY_CONTAINER_PORT` -> `gateway.port`
   - `NANOBOT_LMS_BACKEND_URL` -> `tools.mcpServers.lms.env.NANOBOT_LMS_BACKEND_URL`
   - `NANOBOT_LMS_API_KEY` -> `tools.mcpServers.lms.env.NANOBOT_LMS_API_KEY`

4. Build and deploy. Because some services use `additional_contexts`, you must **build first** and then start:

   ```terminal
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret build nanobot
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret up -d
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > `docker compose up --build` may fail with a "workspace" context error. Always `build` the service first, then `up -d` separately.

5. Check that the service starts cleanly:

   ```terminal
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret ps
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret logs nanobot --tail 50
   ```

   Expected good signs in the logs:

   - `Using config: /app/nanobot/config.resolved.json`
   - `Channels enabled: webchat`
   - `MCP server 'lms': connected`
   - `Agent loop started`

   > [!TIP]
   > **Troubleshooting common issues:**
   >
   > **"Error: Connection error" in Flutter chat** — the agent can't reach the LLM. The `entrypoint.py` must read the **same env var names** that the compose scaffold passes. Check: `docker exec <nanobot-container> grep apiBase /app/nanobot/config.resolved.json` — if the value is empty, the entrypoint isn't picking up the LLM env vars. Compare the variable names in `docker-compose.yml` (under the nanobot service's `environment:`) with what `entrypoint.py` reads via its `Settings(BaseSettings)` class.
   >
   > **Empty page at /flutter** — the Flutter volume isn't mounted in Caddy. Make sure `client-web-flutter:/srv/flutter:ro` is uncommented in the caddy service's `volumes:`.
   >
   > **"Connection lost" in Flutter** — WebSocket rejected the access key. Clear browser data for the site and re-enter your `NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY`.
   >
   > **Slow replies in Flutter** — if the model is busy or rate-limited, a response may take 10-30 seconds. Slow does not automatically mean broken deployment.
   >
   > **`client-web-flutter` is not "Up" like other services** — that can be normal. It is a build/copy container that writes the compiled app into a Docker volume, not a long-running server process.


### Checkpoint for Part A

1. `docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret ps` — nanobot service is running.
2. `docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret logs nanobot --tail 50` shows the gateway started without crashing.
3. Paste a short startup log excerpt into `REPORT.md` under `## Task 2A — Deployed agent`.

## Part B — Add the WebSocket channel and Flutter web client

Nanobot doesn't ship with a WebSocket channel — it has Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, etc. but no raw WebSocket. We built a custom channel plugin (`nanobot_webchat`) that adds this capability, a small MCP server (`mcp_webchat`) that can deliver structured UI messages back to the active chat, and a Flutter web app that connects to it.

All of these pieces are in a single repository. The webchat stack handles:

- WebSocket connections protected by a deployment access key (`?access_key=...` query param, validated against `NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY`)
- Structured response rendering when you want it (`choice`, `confirm`, `composite`)
- Delivery of structured UI payloads from the agent through the `mcp_webchat` MCP tool

> [!NOTE]
> Keep the client generic. Buttons/chips are optional. A clear welcome message and a good first prompt are more important than fancy UI.
>
> The repo-local workspace already includes a shared `structured-ui` skill.
> Your work in this task is to wire `mcp-webchat` correctly and make sure your
> student-written LMS skill cooperates with that shared UI layer.

### What to do in Part B

1. Add the WebSocket channel repo as a submodule:

   ```terminal
   git submodule add https://github.com/inno-se-toolkit/nanobot-websocket-channel
   ```

   This repo contains a `nanobot-websocket-channel/` workspace with four relevant parts:
   - `nanobot-webchat/` — the Python project for the WebSocket channel plugin
   - `mcp-webchat/` — the Python project for the MCP server that sends structured UI messages to the active web chat
   - `client-web-flutter/` — Flutter web chat UI
   - `client-telegram-bot/` — Telegram bot (optional task)

   All four live under `nanobot-websocket-channel/`.

   If you use the repository root `uv` workspace tooling, also uncomment the
   matching `nanobot-websocket-channel` Python package lines in the root
   `pyproject.toml` under:

   - `[tool.uv.workspace].members`
   - `[tool.uv.sources]`

   For this task, that usually means:

   - `nanobot-websocket-channel/nanobot-channel-protocol`
   - `nanobot-websocket-channel/mcp-webchat`
   - `nanobot-websocket-channel/nanobot-webchat`

2. Uncomment `mcp-webchat` and `nanobot-webchat` in `nanobot/pyproject.toml` (marked with `Task 2B`), then sync:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   uv sync
   ```

   These two packages do different jobs:

   - `nanobot-webchat` registers the `webchat` channel type in nanobot via a Python entry point
   - `mcp-webchat` provides an MCP tool for sending structured UI payloads back to the active chat

   The current tool name exposed to the agent is `mcp_webchat_ui_message`.

3. Uncomment the webchat sections in `entrypoint.py` (marked with `Task 2B`) so it injects the webchat channel settings and the webchat MCP server settings from Docker env vars:

   - enables the `webchat` channel with host/port from `NANOBOT_WEBCHAT_CONTAINER_ADDRESS` and `NANOBOT_WEBCHAT_CONTAINER_PORT`
   - configures an MCP server that runs `python -m mcp_webchat`
   - passes the UI relay URL and token to that MCP server via environment variables

   In the current stack, that MCP server is what lets the agent send validated `choice`, `confirm`, and `composite` payloads to the active browser chat instead of printing raw JSON into a text answer.

   You do not need to add the webchat channel to `config.json` — the entrypoint injects it at runtime from the Docker env vars above.

   Also uncomment the matching webchat environment variables in the `nanobot` service block in `docker-compose.yml` (also marked with `Task 2B`).

4. The shared `structured-ui` skill should handle the generic UI behavior.
   Your LMS skill should still cooperate with it by doing the LMS-specific part:

   - call `lms_labs` when the user needs to choose a lab
   - provide short, readable lab labels
   - provide stable lab values that can be reused in the follow-up tool call

   By the end of Part B, you should have modified at least:

   - `nanobot/config.json`
   - `nanobot/pyproject.toml`
   - `nanobot/entrypoint.py`
   - `nanobot/workspace/skills/lms/SKILL.md`
   - `caddy/Caddyfile`
   - `docker-compose.yml`

5. Uncomment the scaffolded `/ws/chat` route in `caddy/Caddyfile`, then uncomment the related `nanobot` lines in the `caddy` service inside `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```
   handle /ws/chat {
       reverse_proxy http://nanobot:{$NANOBOT_WEBCHAT_CONTAINER_PORT}
   }
   ```

   You need all three pieces together:
   - `nanobot` in caddy's `depends_on`
   - `NANOBOT_WEBCHAT_CONTAINER_PORT` in caddy's environment
   - the `/ws/chat` route in `Caddyfile`

6. Uncomment the scaffolded `client-web-flutter` service in `docker-compose.yml`:
   - It should build from `nanobot-websocket-channel/client-web-flutter/`
   - It should write the compiled app into the `client-web-flutter` named volume

7. Uncomment the scaffolded Flutter-related lines in the `caddy` service and `caddy/Caddyfile`:
   - Mount the Flutter volume at `/srv/flutter:ro`
   - Add `client-web-flutter` to `depends_on`
   - Enable the `/flutter` route:

   ```
   handle_path /flutter* {
       root * /srv/flutter
       try_files {path} /index.html
       file_server
   }
   ```

8. Build the Flutter client and redeploy:

   ```terminal
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret build client-web-flutter
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret up -d
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > After rebuilding the Flutter client, do a hard refresh in the browser so
   > you do not keep stale JavaScript assets.

9. Test the WebSocket endpoint through Caddy with the deployment access key:

   ```terminal
   echo '{"content":"What labs are available?"}' | websocat "ws://localhost:42002/ws/chat?access_key=YOUR_NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY"
   ```

   If `websocat` is not installed on your VM, use a short Python fallback
   instead of blocking on tooling:

   ```terminal
   uv run python - <<'PY'
   import asyncio
   import json
   import websockets

   async def main():
       uri = "ws://localhost:42002/ws/chat?access_key=YOUR_NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY"
       async with websockets.connect(uri) as ws:
           await ws.send(json.dumps({"content": "What labs are available?"}))
           print(await ws.recv())

   asyncio.run(main())
   PY
   ```

10. Open `http://<your-vm-ip-address>:42002/flutter` in your browser. Log in with your `NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY`. Start by asking the agent:
    - `What can you do in this system?`
    - `How is the backend doing?`
    - `Show me the scores`

    > [!TIP]
    > The Flutter client stores the access key in browser storage. If login
    > behaves strangely after you typed a wrong key once, clear site data or
    > use the logout button and log in again.

    If the web client is working, the nanobot logs should show something like:

    - `Processing message from webchat:...`
    - `Tool call: mcp_lms_lms_labs({...})` or `Tool call: mcp_lms_lms_health({...})`
    - `Tool call: mcp_webchat_ui_message({...})` when the agent sends a structured UI reply
    - `Response to webchat:...`

    A healthy end-to-end path looks like this:

    - the login screen appears at `/flutter`
    - the access key is accepted
    - the agent answers a general capability question
    - the agent answers an LMS-backed question using real tools
    - when you ask an ambiguous question such as `Show me the scores`, the client renders a structured lab choice instead of showing raw JSON

    Quick troubleshooting map:

    - wrong access key -> login rejected or WebSocket closes immediately
    - slow model -> answer arrives late, but the socket stays alive
    - stale frontend bundle -> hard refresh fixes missing recent UI changes
    - blank `/flutter` page -> check the Flutter volume mount and Caddy route
    - raw JSON appears in chat instead of buttons -> check that `mcp-webchat` is installed, wired into `mcpServers`, and referenced by your skill/agent instructions

    Common symptom table:

    | Symptom                                      | Likely cause                                     | First thing to check                                                      |
    | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Login appears to work, then chat disconnects | stale browser state or bad access key handling   | clear site data and log in again with the current `NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY`    |
    | Login works, but replies take a long time    | model/API latency                                | check `qwen-code-api` and `nanobot` logs before assuming the UI is broken |
    | `/flutter` loads old behavior after rebuild  | stale frontend assets                            | hard refresh the browser page                                             |
    | Login works but no agent reply ever arrives  | broken `/ws/chat` proxy or backend/channel issue | check Caddy `/ws/chat`, `nanobot` logs, and a direct WebSocket request    |


### Checkpoint for Part B

1. `websocat "ws://localhost:42002/ws/chat?access_key=YOUR_NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY"` returns a real agent response.
2. Open `http://<your-vm-ip-address>:42002/flutter` — you should see a login screen.
3. Log in with your `NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY`, ask `What can you do in this system?`, then ask `How is the backend doing?`
4. The second answer should be backed by real LMS/backend data, not just a generic greeting.
5. Ask `Show me the scores` without naming a lab. If multiple labs exist, the client should render a structured choice prompt rather than raw JSON text.
6. Screenshot the conversation and add it to `REPORT.md` under `## Task 2B — Web client`. The screenshot should show at least one real agent answer and, if multiple labs exist, the structured lab-choice UI.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- Nanobot runs as a Docker Compose service via `nanobot gateway`.
- After the webchat channel is installed, the WebSocket endpoint at `/ws/chat` responds when called with the correct `access_key`.
- The webchat channel plugin is installed and the Flutter client connects through it.
- The `mcp-webchat` MCP server is installed and wired so the agent can deliver structured UI messages to the active chat.
- The Flutter web client is accessible at `/flutter` and protected by a student-chosen `NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY`.
- The provided shared `structured-ui` skill works with the student's LMS skill so lab-selection prompts can render as structured choices in the Flutter client instead of dumping raw JSON.
- `REPORT.md` contains responses from both checkpoints.
