# Task 1 — Set Up the Agent

## Background

In Lab 7 you built a Telegram bot with your own LLM tool-calling loop — you wrote the code that sends messages to the LLM, parses tool calls, executes them, and feeds results back. That works, but it means every new client needs the same loop reimplemented from scratch.

**Nanobot** (also called OpenClaw) is a **framework** that does all of that for you. Instead of writing the loop, you **configure** it. Here's the difference:

| What you did in Lab 7 (manual)                  | What nanobot does (framework)                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wrote a Python tool-calling loop                | Built-in agent loop — you just provide config                                                                                                      |
| Defined tools as Python dicts with JSON schemas | **MCP server** — a separate process that exposes typed tools via a standard protocol. Any agent can use them, not just your code.                  |
| Hardcoded which tools to call and when          | **Skills** — natural language prompts that teach the agent *strategy* ("when the user asks about errors, search logs first, then fetch the trace") |
| Built one client (Telegram bot)                 | **Channels** — WebSocket, Telegram, etc. One agent, many clients.                                                                                  |
| No memory between conversations                 | **Memory** — the agent remembers context across conversations                                                                                      |
| Agent only responds when you message it         | **Cron** — the agent can act on a schedule (e.g., check system health every 15 minutes)                                                            |

Start by reading the [official nanobot repository](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) to understand how the framework works.

## Part A — Install nanobot and chat with it

### What to do in Part A

1. Uncomment `"nanobot"` and `nanobot = { workspace = true, editable = true }` in the root `pyproject.toml` (marked with `Task 1`) so the workspace recognizes the repo-local `nanobot` project.

2. Enter the `nanobot` project directory:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   ```

   From this point on, treat `nanobot/` inside the repository as the source of truth for this lab.
   Later tasks should build on this same project instead of copying state from your home directory.

3. Install the tested nanobot version:

   ```terminal
   uv add "nanobot-ai @ https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/archive/e7d371ec1e6531b28898ec2c869ef338e8dd46ec.zip"
   ```

   > [!CAUTION]
   > The latest released version (`v0.1.4.post5`) is infected (see [#2439](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues/2439)). So, don't download this version from `GitHub` or `PyPI`.

4. Run the onboard wizard to generate the initial configuration and workspace:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   uv run nanobot onboard -c config.json --workspace ./workspace
   ```

   The wizard will guide you through configuring the LLM provider.

   `N = refresh config, keeping existing values and adding new fields` - Type `N` and press `Enter`.

   Set up the **custom** provider (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) and point it to the `Qwen Code` API:
   - **agents.defaults.workspace** `./workspace`
   - **agents.defaults.model** `coder-model`
   - **agents.defaults.provider** `custom`
   - **providers.custom.apiKey** your `QWEN_CODE_API_KEY` from `.env.docker.secret`
   - **providers.custom.apiBase** `http://localhost:42005/v1`

   This generates `config.json` and a `workspace/` directory in the current folder.
   Task 2 will Dockerize this same repo-local project.

5. Chat with the repo-local agent in the terminal on your VM:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   uv run nanobot agent --logs --session cli:task1a-chat -c ./config.json
   ```

   This starts an interactive CLI session. Try asking:
   - "Hello! What can you do?"
   - "What is the agentic loop?" (quiz question Q18)
   - "What labs are available in our LMS?"

   The agent answers general questions well, but it still has no **live LMS backend access** yet.
   Depending on the nanobot version, it may inspect local repo files with built-in tools and give a plausible answer based on docs, but it cannot query real LMS data until Part B adds the MCP server.

6. Try a single-message query:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   uv run nanobot agent --logs --session cli:task1a-oneshot -c ./config.json -m "What is 2+2?"
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Keep `--logs` enabled while developing so you can see tool registration and tool calls.
   >
   > When comparing behavior before and after MCP or skills, always use a fresh
   > session name such as `--session cli:task1a`, `--session cli:task1b`, or
   > `--session cli:task1c` instead of reusing `cli:direct`.


### Checkpoint for Part A

1. Run `cd nanobot && uv run nanobot agent --logs --session cli:task1a-loop -c ./config.json -m "What is the agentic loop?"` — you should get a reasonable answer.
2. Run `cd nanobot && uv run nanobot agent --logs --session cli:task1a-labs -c ./config.json -m "What labs are available in our LMS?"` — it should **not** return real backend data. It may say it does not know, or it may inspect local repo files and answer from documentation instead of the live LMS.
3. Paste both responses into `REPORT.md` under `## Task 1A — Bare agent`.

## Part B — Connect the agent to the LMS backend

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard way for agents to use tools. Instead of defining tools as JSON schemas in your code (like in Lab 7), you write a **separate server** that exposes typed tools. The agent connects to this server and discovers what's available.

The same MCP server works with any agent that speaks MCP — nanobot, Claude, Cursor, or anything else. Your tools become reusable.

### What to do in Part B

The LMS MCP server is provided in `mcp/mcp-lms/`. It exposes the backend API as tools: `lms_health`, `lms_labs`, `lms_pass_rates`, etc.

1. Uncomment `mcp-lms` in `nanobot/pyproject.toml` (marked with `Task 1`), then sync:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   uv sync
   ```

2. Add the MCP server to your repo-local nanobot config (`nanobot/config.json`). It runs as a subprocess via `python -m mcp_lms`.

   The MCP part of your config should look like this:

   ```json
   {
     "tools": {
       "mcpServers": {
         "lms": {
           "command": "python",
           "args": ["-m", "mcp_lms"]
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > `python -m mcp_lms` works here because you start nanobot with `uv run`.
   > The MCP subprocess inherits the same Python environment, so `python` resolves
   > to the repo-local interpreter where `mcp-lms` is installed.

   > **Hint:** The MCP server needs the backend URL and backend API key. Pass them as environment variables:
   > `NANOBOT_LMS_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:42002`
   > `NANOBOT_LMS_API_KEY=...`
   >
   > The LMS key stays on the agent side. Later, the web client will use a separate `NANOBOT_ACCESS_KEY`, not the backend key.
   >
   > Do not assume `${VAR}` placeholders inside `config.json` will be expanded for you.
   > Either pass the variables inline on the command line, or add a real `env`
   > object under `mcpServers.lms` if you want the config file itself to provide
   > them.

3. Test with the agent:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   NANOBOT_LMS_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:42002 NANOBOT_LMS_API_KEY=YOUR_LMS_API_KEY uv run nanobot agent --logs --session cli:task1b-labs -c ./config.json -m "What labs are available?"
   ```

   The agent should now call the MCP tools and return **real lab names** from the backend.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the agent reports that the backend is healthy but there are no labs yet,
   > ask it to trigger the LMS sync pipeline, then retry the question.

4. Try a more complex question:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   NANOBOT_LMS_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:42002 NANOBOT_LMS_API_KEY=YOUR_LMS_API_KEY uv run nanobot agent --logs --session cli:task1b-pass-rates -c ./config.json -m "Which lab has the lowest pass rate?"
   ```

   The agent should chain multiple tool calls to figure this out.


### Checkpoint for Part B

1. Ask the agent **"What labs are available?"** — it should return real lab names (e.g., `lab-01`, `lab-02`).
2. Ask the agent **"Is the LMS backend healthy?"** — it should answer from the LMS tool and mention a real health result such as the item count.
3. Paste both responses into `REPORT.md` under `## Task 1B — Agent with LMS tools`.

## Part C — Write a skill prompt

The agent works, but it could be smarter about *how* it uses tools. A **skill prompt** teaches the agent strategy — when to use which tool, how to handle authentication, how to format responses.

### What to do in Part C

1. Write a skill prompt in your repo-local nanobot workspace, for example at `nanobot/workspace/skills/lms/SKILL.md`.

   The repo-local workspace already includes a shared `structured-ui` skill for
   generic choice/confirm/composite behavior on supported chat channels. Your
   job here is to create the **LMS-specific** skill. Do not copy generic UI
   rules into the LMS skill unless you are adding LMS-specific details such as
   which options to show and which values to pass back.

   Start it with frontmatter so nanobot loads it reliably:

   ```md
   ---
   name: lms
   description: Use LMS MCP tools for live course data
   always: true
   ---
   ```

   The skill should teach the agent:
   - Which `lms_*` tools are available and when to use each one
   - When a lab parameter is needed and not provided, ask the user which lab
   - When lab choice is needed, call `lms_labs` first and provide good lab labels/values for the shared UI layer
   - Format numeric results nicely (percentages, counts)
   - Keep responses concise
   - When the user asks "what can you do?", explain its current tools and limits clearly

   A good strategy rule looks like this:

   - if the user asks for scores, pass rates, completion, groups, timeline, or top learners without naming a lab, call `lms_labs` first
   - if multiple labs are available, ask the user to choose one
   - use each lab title as the default user-facing label unless the tool output gives a better identifier
   - let the shared `structured-ui` skill decide how to present that choice on supported channels

   > **Hint:** Look at the tools in `mcp/mcp-lms/src/mcp_lms/server.py` to see what's available and what parameters each tool needs.

2. Test the difference with a fresh session name so old conversation state does not leak into the result:

   ```terminal
   cd nanobot
   uv run nanobot agent --logs --session cli:task1c -c ./config.json -m "Show me the scores"
   ```


### Checkpoint for Part C

1. Ask the agent **"Show me the scores"** (without specifying a lab) — it should ask you which lab, or list available labs. At this stage a plain text follow-up is fine; Task 2 will connect structured UI delivery for web clients.
2. Paste the response into `REPORT.md` under `## Task 1C — Skill prompt`.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- Nanobot is installed in the repo-local `nanobot/` project from either the `main` archive or a pinned commit archive, and configured via `nanobot onboard`.
- The agent responds to general questions via the repo-local `nanobot/config.json`.
- MCP tools are configured and the agent returns real backend data.
- The provided shared `structured-ui` skill remains generic, while a student-written LMS skill guides LMS-specific tool usage and missing-lab handling.
- `REPORT.md` contains responses from all three checkpoints.
