# Task 3 — Give the Agent New Eyes (Observability)

## Background

Your agent can query application data — labs, scores, learners. But when something breaks, it's blind. It can't see logs, it can't see traces, it can't tell you what went wrong.

The backend already has **structured logging** and **distributed tracing** set up via OpenTelemetry. Logs flow into **VictoriaLogs** and traces flow into **VictoriaTraces** — both are running in your Docker Compose stack. But nobody has given the agent access to this data yet.

In this task you first learn to read the observability data yourself, then give the agent the same ability by writing MCP tools. This is the same pattern as Task 1: take a service API, wrap it as MCP tools, write a skill prompt, and the agent gains a new capability.

### What is structured logging?

When services print `INFO: 127.0.0.1:54032 - "GET /items/ HTTP/1.1" 200`, that's unstructured text. Finding "all errors from the backend in the last hour" means grepping through thousands of lines.

**Structured logging** means each entry is JSON with consistent fields:

```json
{"level": "error", "service": "backend", "event": "db_query", "error": "connection refused"}
```

Now you can filter by any field: "show me all entries where `service=backend` and `level=error`."

### What is VictoriaLogs?

A log database. Stores structured JSON logs, lets you search with LogsQL. Has a web UI and an HTTP API. Think: `grep` on steroids with time range filtering and instant results.

### What is VictoriaTraces?

When a request flows through multiple services, each step is a **span**. All spans for one request form a **trace**. VictoriaTraces stores these and shows a timeline view — like a debugger call stack across network boundaries.

Both are already running in your Docker Compose stack.

## Part A — Explore structured logs

The backend already emits structured log events via OpenTelemetry.

### What to do in Part A

1. Trigger a request through the Flutter app (e.g., ask the agent "what labs are available?").

2. Run `docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret logs backend --tail 30` and find the log entries for your request. You should see structured events like `request_started`, `auth_success`, `db_query`, and `request_completed`.

3. Trigger a failure — stop PostgreSQL and make another request:

   ```terminal
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret stop postgres
   ```

   Check the logs again. You should see `db_query` with an error-level record and a failed request status on the matching request. Depending on how the failure surfaces in your stack, this may be `404`, `500`, or another non-success status.

4. Restart PostgreSQL:

   ```terminal
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret start postgres
   ```

5. Open the VictoriaLogs web UI at `http://<your-vm-ip-address>:42002/utils/victorialogs/select/vmui`. Run a LogsQL query that filters by service and error level. Compare how easy this is versus grepping `docker compose logs`.

   In this stack, the most useful fields are `service.name`, `severity`, `event`, and `trace_id`. A good query to start with is:

   ```text
   _time:1h service.name:"Learning Management Service" severity:ERROR
   ```

   If you want to focus only on the failure you just triggered, narrow the window further, for example:

   ```text
   _time:10m service.name:"Learning Management Service" severity:ERROR
   ```

   If the UI feels noisy, you may also query the VictoriaLogs HTTP API directly while debugging. Still use the UI for the screenshot in the checkpoint.



### Checkpoint for Part A

1. Paste a happy-path log excerpt (showing `request_started` → `request_completed` with status 200) into `REPORT.md` under `## Task 3A — Structured logging`.
2. Paste an error-path log excerpt (showing `db_query` with error) into the same section.
3. Screenshot a VictoriaLogs query result and add it to `REPORT.md`.

## Part B — Explore traces

### What to do in Part B

1. Open the VictoriaTraces UI at `http://<your-vm-ip-address>:42002/utils/victoriatraces`.

   If you query VictoriaTraces directly over HTTP from inside the stack, use the Jaeger-compatible API exposed by VictoriaTraces itself. In this deployment that means URLs shaped like:

   ```text
   http://victoriatraces:10428/select/jaeger/api/traces?service=<name>&limit=<N>
   http://victoriatraces:10428/select/jaeger/api/traces/<traceID>
   ```

   If the UI is difficult to navigate, it is fine to use the HTTP API to confirm you found the correct trace first, then return to the UI for screenshots.

2. Trigger a request through the Flutter app and find the resulting trace. Inspect the span hierarchy — which services appear, how long each step took.

   The easiest way to find the matching trace is:

   - look up the request in logs first
   - copy the `trace_id` field from the log record
   - open that trace in VictoriaTraces

3. Trigger a failure (stop PostgreSQL), make another request, and find that trace too. Compare the healthy and error traces — where does the error appear?

4. Restart PostgreSQL.

### Checkpoint for Part B

1. Screenshot a healthy trace showing the span hierarchy.
2. Screenshot an error trace showing where the failure occurred.
3. Add both screenshots to `REPORT.md` under `## Task 3B — Traces`.

## Part C — Add observability MCP tools

The agent still can't access logs or traces — only you can, through the UIs. Let's fix that.

### What to do in Part C

1. Implement new MCP tools that query VictoriaLogs and VictoriaTraces. Add them to a separate MCP server such as `mcp/mcp-obs/`, or use an equivalent new MCP module. You need at least:

   If you use the repository root `uv` workspace tooling, also uncomment the
   matching `mcp/mcp-obs` lines in the root `pyproject.toml` under:

   - `[tool.uv.workspace].members`
   - `[tool.uv.sources]`

   **Log tools (VictoriaLogs HTTP API — port 9428):**
   - `logs_search` — search logs by keyword and/or time range
   - `logs_error_count` — count errors per service over a time window

   > **Hint:** VictoriaLogs query API: `POST /select/logsql/query` or `GET /select/logsql/query?query=<LogsQL>&limit=<N>`.
   >
   > In this stack, the real field names are things like `service.name`, `severity`, `event`, and `trace_id`.
   >
   > Example:
   >
   > ```text
   > _time:10m service.name:"Learning Management Service" severity:ERROR
   > ```

   **Trace tools (VictoriaTraces HTTP API — port 10428, Jaeger-compatible):**
   - `traces_list` — list recent traces for a service
   - `traces_get` — fetch a specific trace by ID

   > **Hint:** In this deployment the VictoriaTraces service exposes the Jaeger-compatible API under `/select/jaeger/api/...`, for example:
   >
   > ```text
   > GET /select/jaeger/api/traces?service=<name>&limit=<N>
   > GET /select/jaeger/api/traces/<traceID>
   > ```

2. Uncomment the obs scaffolds (all marked with `Task 3`) so nanobot can find and run the new MCP server:

   - `nanobot/pyproject.toml` — uncomment `"mcp-obs"`
   - `nanobot/entrypoint.py` — uncomment the `nanobot_victorialogs_url` and `nanobot_victoriatraces_url` fields in `Settings`, and the `obs` MCP server block in `_resolve_config()`
   - `docker-compose.yml` — uncomment `NANOBOT_VICTORIALOGS_URL` and `NANOBOT_VICTORIATRACES_URL` in the nanobot service environment

3. Write an observability skill prompt (e.g., `nanobot/workspace/skills/observability/SKILL.md`) that teaches the agent:
   - When the user asks about errors, search logs first
   - If you find a trace ID in the logs, fetch the full trace
   - Summarize findings concisely — don't dump raw JSON

   The repo-local workspace already includes a shared `structured-ui` skill for
   generic choice/confirm/composite behavior on supported chat channels. Keep
   your observability skill focused on observability reasoning rather than
   duplicating that generic UI guidance.

4. Redeploy and test. Ask the agent: **"Any errors in the last hour?"**

   Good files to expect by the end of Part C:

   - `mcp/mcp-obs/src/mcp_obs/server.py`
   - `mcp/mcp-obs/src/mcp_obs/observability.py` or the equivalent new MCP module
   - `nanobot/pyproject.toml` (uncommented `mcp-obs`)
   - `nanobot/entrypoint.py` (uncommented obs MCP server)
   - `docker-compose.yml` (uncommented obs env vars)
   - `nanobot/workspace/skills/observability/SKILL.md`

   Good nanobot logs to expect after redeploy:

   - `mcp_obs_logs_search`
   - `mcp_obs_logs_error_count`
   - `mcp_obs_traces_list`
   - `mcp_obs_traces_get`

   Intended reasoning flow for a good answer:

   - `logs_error_count` to see whether there are recent errors
   - `logs_search` to inspect the relevant service and extract a recent `trace_id`
   - `traces_get` to inspect the failing request path
   - a short summary instead of raw JSON

   For this task, prefer a scoped prompt such as **"Any LMS backend errors in the last 10 minutes?"** so the answer is driven by fresh LMS telemetry instead of unrelated older errors from other services.

### Checkpoint for Part C

1. Ask the agent **"Any LMS backend errors in the last 10 minutes?"** under normal conditions.

   If you still see unrelated historical errors, tighten the scope further by using an even narrower time window or explicitly asking about the LMS backend.

2. Stop PostgreSQL, trigger a few LMS-backed requests, then ask **"Any LMS backend errors in the last 10 minutes?"** again. The agent should report the new backend errors you just caused, not just unrelated older errors from other services.
   Trigger the failure and ask the question immediately afterward so the answer is based on fresh data from a narrow time window.

3. Restart PostgreSQL.

4. Paste both responses into `REPORT.md` under `## Task 3C — Observability MCP tools`.
